# QuestEssence
QuestEssence is a React Native app which provides a fun and engaging way to explore world's most famous landmarks

QuestEssence allows you to explore world's most famous landmarks in the form of quests - sets of puzzles and
questions you need to solve to progress in the quest.

This project was never properly completed and launched. This is just a demo app which I created to showcase the idea.
It fully works and has 3 dummy quests built in to demonstrate its functions.

This app is developed with React Native and Redux. It works on both Android and iOS, though not available
in the App Store due to me being broke af. It uses Firebase as a remote database where quests and user
progress are stored. Progress synchronization with the server will be enabled if you log in with your 
facebook account (you will be prompted when downloading a quest). Note that we only ask for a public 
facebook profile and don't store any of your data in our database except for user id which facebook auth returns.

The app is available in English and Russian and will automatically switch depending on your phoneâ€™s language setting.
